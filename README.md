# React Curriculum

A robust and optimized Server-Side Rendering (SSR) service, built with **React**, state management via **Redux**, styling with **SCSS**, and focused on data efficiency through a **single API request**.

---

## Technologies Used

This project was developed using the following main technologies:

* **React:** JavaScript library for building reactive and component-based user interfaces.
* **Redux:** Library for global application state management, ensuring predictability and ease of debugging.
* **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Initial React rendering on the server, providing better loading performance, improved SEO, and a faster user experience.
* **Vite:** Optimizes the overall application development process.
* **SCSS (Sass):** CSS pre-processor that adds features like variables, mixins, and nesting, making styling more organized and scalable.

## Key Features

* **Optimized Performance:** Thanks to SSR, pages load faster and content is visible almost instantly.
* **Centralized State Management:** Redux offers a clear architecture for handling complex application state.
* **Efficient Styling:** SCSS allows for modular and easily maintainable style development.
* **Bandwidth Saving:** The single API request eliminates the overhead of multiple HTTP calls, crucial for Vercel's free tier and for users with limited connections.
* **SEO Friendly:** Pre-rendered content in HTML facilitates indexing by search engines.

## How to Run the Project Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your machine:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm or Yarn

### Setup

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/blink992/react_curriculum_render.git](https://github.com/blink992/react_curriculum_render.git)
    cd react_curriculum_render
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **API Configuration:**
    This project expects a **RESTful resume API** to be running at an accessible address.

    * Create a `.env` file in the project root (if necessary) and define your API's URL:
        ```
        VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
        ```
    * Ensure the API is running and accessible.

### Running the Project

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
````

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or another available port).
You can access / for log with you username and password or /curriculum:token for receive the resume by token, for example: http://localhost:3000/curriculum/token_code_12345.
You can get a token when registering your resume data or after log in, when click in Copy URL button. A new token is generated every time you access the resume

The Register Curriculum Service is in development.
